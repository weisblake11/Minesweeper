Please Read:
       Within my project directory, I have a src directory which holds my Minesweeper.java file, and I have a bin folder which contains the package that holds the Minesweeper.class file. So for this, please assume the user is in the project directory (not the same directory as Minesweeper.java)

To compile:
   javac -d bin src/Minesweeper.java

To run:
   java -cp bin cs1302.p1.Minesweeper [FILE]
or
   java -cp bin cs1302.p1.Minesweeper [ROWS] [COLS]
